# Experiences in Using R for Automating Administrative Procedures: Cost Recovery in the Public Health System of the City of Buenos Aires.

For LatinR 2024, together with Ariana Bardauil and Manuel Rodr√≠guez Tablado, we presented "Experiences in Using R for Automating Administrative Procedures: Cost Recovery in the Public Health System of the City of Buenos Aires."

In our talk, we shared our experience as part of the Information Management and Health Statistics Office (GOGIES) of the Ministry of Health of the City of Buenos Aires, where we designed and implemented a project to automate administrative records for expenses recovery in the public health system.

The recovery of expenses in public health in the City of Buenos Aires aims to recover the costs of treating patients with health services coverage who receive medical attention in the public subsector. GOGIES has automated the generation of the necessary documentation for this process through the use of R and open software, resulting in an immediate impact on saving working hours for public workers and leading to an effective recovery of expenses in the City.
